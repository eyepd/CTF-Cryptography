Practical Cryptography
Practical Cryptography has resources for learning to break classical ciphers (as opposed to just decrypting the message!) http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/

There are many, many more ciphers and encodings and resources, this is just a place to start! Now go crack some codes!
